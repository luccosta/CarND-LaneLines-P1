Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle. Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I had detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.

To complete the project, two files are being submitted: a file containing [project code](https://github.com/luccosta/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb) and a file containing a brief [write up](https://github.com/luccosta/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_project_01.md) explaining my solution. The code file is called P1.ipynb and the writeup is writeup_project_01.md.

To meet specifications in the project, take a look at the requirements in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view).


Writeup
---
For this project, I provided a detailed response to the "Reflection" section of the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view). There are three parts to the reflection:

1. Describe the pipeline

2. Identify any shortcomings

3. Suggest possible improvements
